                            Flowbite is an open-source library of interactive components built on top of Tailwind CSS including buttons, dropdowns, modals, navbars, and more.

                        Is there a Figma file available?

                            Flowbite is first conceptualized and designed using the Figma software so everything you see in the library has a design equivalent in our Figma file.

                        What are the differences between Flowbite and Tailwind UI?

                        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                            The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite are open source under the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is a paid product. Another difference is that Flowbite relies on smaller and standalone components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.
